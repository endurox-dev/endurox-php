                                Function API

NOTE: At this point in this products development cycle, it is assumed users
have some understanding of basic Tuxedo client development. Many of these
functions have a strong relationship to the original BEA Tuxedo API
function. I recommend you where necessary refer to this documentation for
additional information. BEA has their documentation online
at:http://edocs.bea.com/tuxedo/tux65/index.htm. The Reference Material and
Bookshelf are particularly good references.

                         Function                                      Description                 Version        Status

 tux_array2fml                                            Move array values into FML             0.2.0        Tested
                                                          tux_array2fml (buffer #, array)
                                                          buffer#: The Tuxedo buffer reference number for values to be
                                                          stored in. Must be a valid FML/FML32 Tuxedo buffer.
                                                          array: a 1 or 2 dimensional array to move the values from. The
                                                          first dimension key should be the FML/FML32 Field names (a string)
                                                          according to the Field Definition file. The second dimmension key
                                                          (if present) will be taken as the FIELDID occurenence values,
                                                          starting with 0. Skipped occurences result in a NULL FML field id.

                                                          Returns TRUE/FALSE

                                                          Stores the values from the provided array into the destination
                                                          FML/FML32 buffer. Values are placed into the FML buffer with the
                                                          Fchg Tuxedo API function. See the examples for a simple usage.

                                                          This function has no single equivalent Tuxedo API function.

 Low Level FML/FML32 Functions
 Most of these FML functions have one-for-one equivalents
 to the raw Tuxedo FML functions. Where possible, the
 correct FML/FML32 calls are detected; however on some
 calls this is not possible so you must provide a type
 argument.

 The list of these functions will likely grow in future
 releases. I tried to pick out the functions that were
 either very commonly used and/or with no equivalent
 method already created. If you find a specific function
 not listed here is needed, they can be created easily.
 Send me an email.

 NOTE: As of version 0.4.0, the following functions
 (tux_fdelall, tux_foccur, tux_fdel, tux_flen, tux_fpres,
 tux_fadd, and tux_fget) can take a Field Name string in
 place of the Field ID parameter. If the provided
 argument is a string (as defined in PHP) the fldid
 function will be called to convert the string to its
 Field ID before processing.
 tux_fadd                                                 Add new field occurrence.              0.3.0        Tested

                                                          buff#: The buffer reference number for the data value to be added.

                                                          field_id: If numeric, the numerical field id for data to be added.
                                                          If string, the Field Name for the corresponding Field ID. The
                                                          conversion is automatic.

                                                          data: Data value to be added. The type of data is determined by
                                                          the Field_ID type given. The length of the data value is
                                                          automatically determined by the type and PHP.

                                                          occur: An optional field to allow the specification of a Field_ID
                                                          specific occurrence. If the value is not specified, -1 is assumed
                                                          which means to add the data as the next occurrence.

                                                          Return value is a long.

                                                          tux_fadd and tux_fchg are aliased to the same function code. The
                                                          only difference between the two original functions is Fchg allowed
                                                          the specification of an occurrence where Fadd did not.

 tux_fchg                                                 Add / change new field occurrence.     0.3.0        Tested

                                                          may be inspected by the receiving process to verify that the
                                                          entire buffer was received.

                                                          Returns a string containing the error description for ferror.
                                                          ferror can be retrieved from the api function tux_get_ferror.

                                                          Returns a string containing the name of the type of a field, given
                                                          a field identifier.

                                                          Return value is a string.

                                                          The type parameter is required because the function does not take
                                                          a FML buffer reference so it doesn't know how to do the mapping.
